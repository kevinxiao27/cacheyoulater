                    I canâ€™t believe we are 21 already. It feels as if it was
                    yesterday when we walked into the kindergarten classroom,
                    and the teacher made us sit together. I guess I have one
                    thing to thank Mrs. Palmer for: giving me the best friends
                    ever. I know work is stressing you all out lately but I hope
                    this was a little way to relax!
